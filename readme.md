## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

This site is built using the following amazing tech:

- **HTML5** for the structure. Simple, clean, y nada mas.
- **CSS3** to jazz up the entire thing:
  - A ridiculous hover animation for the heading ('baile') 💃
  - A jelly animation for the button-squishy and satisfying. ~~I spent way too much time on it~~
  - A conic-basket background for _no reason at all_
- **JavaScript (ES6)** to handle the API and other cool features:
  - Fetching jokes from the API
  - A snazzy typewriter effect for joke delivery
  - The cool bg shiffle too

## 🌟 **Key Features**

### 1. **Jokes on demand**

Click the button to fetch a random dad joke. Each joke gets displayed with a typewriter effect because plain text is too boring.

### 2. **Color Explosiong**

The bg changes color randomly each time you click the button. It's chaotic but oddly satisfying. Perfect for annoying your eyes. And that button, it looks tasty I know. But don't try to eat it. I've tried, trust me, it wasn't a good experience.

### 3. **Clipboard Pirates**

Click the joke, and it'll be copied to your clipboard faster then a parrot grabs a cracker. Don't worry, you'll know it's copied because the text changes to "Copied to clipboard!" for but a mere second of thy life.

### 4. **Responsive Design**

Whether you’re on a tiny mobile screen or a giant monitor, the page adjusts like a pro. Pirate-tested, user-approved.

## 📜 **API Integration**

The site uses the **icanhazdadjoke API** to fetch random jokes. No treasure maps or doubloons required—just pure JSON joy.  
Example response:

```json
{
  "id": "R7UfaahVfFd",
  "joke": "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!",
  "status": 200
}
```

## 🥚 **Easter Eggs (Arrr!)**

- **Heading SHake:** Hover over the title and watch it dance like it's had too much rum.
- **Wobbly Container:** The container rotates slightly when uou hover over it, because that's how pirates sail the seven seas.

## 🐛 **Known Bugs**

- The random colors might not always be your vibe. The parrot says deal with it!
- If the API goes down, the jokes might stop flowing. In such cases, blame the internet gremlims.
- Spamming the jelly button causes the output to be a drunk sailors speech. But why would you spam?
